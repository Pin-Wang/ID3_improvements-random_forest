# ID3_improvements
My improvments on ID3, a classic data mining algorithm

ID3(Iterative Dichotomiser 3) is a classic decision tree algorithm put forward by Quinlan in 1986. 

I will make three improvements on ID3:

1. Change the original information gain to gain ratio when deciding which attribute to split the tree

2. Change the simple voting procedure to naive bayes methods

3. Build up a random forest from many ID3 trees

The projram is written in Java, and runs on Weka platform
